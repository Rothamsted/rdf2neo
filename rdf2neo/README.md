# The RDF-to-Neo4j exporter, Core Library

Please have a look at the [main README](../README.md) for details. 

This is the library providing the GraphML implementation.  

Originally, the rdf2pg software was actually rdf2neo and then it was generalised starting from 
earlier versions of the components in this module.
